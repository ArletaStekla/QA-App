# QA-App

The application purpose is to create e-mails that are modeled on certain standards.
Thanks to the application, the Manager's Incidents save a lot of time because they do not have to manually create e-mails. In particular, when they send a message to an agent who committed more than one mistake. Then the application automatically combines two standards into one email.

The application has been used by a company for half a year and significantly improves the process of generating e-mails.
